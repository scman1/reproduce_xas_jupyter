Exploring the needs to create reproducible notebooks wich support published results

Jupyter Notebooks provide an alternative for processing and analysing data while documenting the process. Each notebook can contain text, code, and present results in a way that makes the processing transparent and reproducible to a high degree.

The data, parameters, code, and results are all mixed, requiring some effort to interpret the notebook in order
to reproduce the results or to reuse code and/or data. 

The person building the code can follow some rules for making the results really reproducible and easy to interpret.
